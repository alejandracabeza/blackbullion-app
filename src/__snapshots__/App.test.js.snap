      <h2>
        Peer Pressure and Advertising
      </h2>
      <p>
        Advertising is something that we are all surrounded by - online, watching TV or driving past a billboard. It can influence us and those around us more than we might realise. In this video, Joe and Jade consider some of the issues around advertising but also peer-pressure before they go shopping. They realise how important it to start assessing what you want to take control of their money.

        Needs, Wants and Budgeting
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are many things that we often consider as ‘needs’ but it might be worth taking a moment to think about whether this is what they actually are. You might find after a little thinking that it’s just a ‘want’. Jade and Joe discuss the financial implications of this in their finance vlog and the importance of budgeting.
